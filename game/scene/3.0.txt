Alexei:Finally, I'm on fire from the Morning Prayer side!
I'm glad I'm not late today... great, great.
I haven't changed out of my friar's uniform yet though, so I'll find a chance to change out of it later.

Alexei:Why are you guys here, waiting to pick me up so early? ;
Kids:Why is my brother wearing a black robe this time?
miniAvatar:alyosha/novice/eyeclosedsmile.png;
Alexei:I came in such a hurry that I didn't have time to change my clothes in the middle of the day.
I'll do it later. Did I scare you?
Kids:The black robe is so big, I feel like I can hide in it during hide-and-seek!

changeFigure:lisa/smile talk.png; ? :Are you guys bullying Alyosha again?

Alexei:!!!!

Lise:I happened to be on my way to a friend's house, so I came by to see if I could run into you... looks like you've got a lot going on today too, huh?
Yikes, why haven't you even changed your robe?
:(The children hid behind Alyosha)
Alexei:Haha, I had a particularly early appointment today, so I had no choice but to rush over early.
Lise:Why don't you guys excuse yourselves, I want to talk to Allyson alone~
If you go away now, I'll give you candy later.
Kids:Yes----
:(kids leave)

Lise:I hope the people coming to counseling don't upset you too much~
Alexei:I hope so, but the counseling affairs over here are still much easier than the ones over at the school.
changeFigure:lisa/smiletalk.png;
Lise:How's your internship at school going.
Alexei:It's actually pretty slow because it's my first internship ......
Lise:Are you having a hard time dealing with your visitors?
Alexei:According to the counseling agreement, I can't disclose information about my visitors.
changeFigure:lisa/smileeyeclosed.png;
Lise:But I know who your visitor is... it's your brother, isn't it?
miniAvatar:alyosha/novice/suprised.png;
Alexei:!
miniAvatar:alyosha/novice/sweatsmile.png;
Lise, I was just talking about this ...... How did you know?
Lise:My mother told me, she probably heard about it from a student she befriended, who would be which one of your brother's classmates.
Alexei:Is that so ....... I can't believe he told this story ...... But forgive me, Lise, if you ask again I won't answer ......
changeFigure:lisa/speakingnormal.png.
Lise:Don't worry, I'm not really interested in your brother, and I know you two don't seem to know each other very well either.
But pardon me for saying so, I don't like that brother of yours either
miniAvatar:alyosha/novice/sweattalk.png;
Alexei:Huh, Lise, did you know him before?
Lise:Can't say I knew him, just heard some things about him before.

Do you remember that neighborhood on the west side, a year ago when I hadn't moved with my mother yet, there was a pretty big thing going on over there at the church that was there.
His father got into an argument with a priest inside that church, and people said that he just stood by and watched and didn't say anything.
He said that afterward he asked the priest to confess on his father's behalf, but it seems that the two of them didn't say a few words, and they saw him leave the church without looking back, but the priest still felt guilty about the incident.
I know he's not a believer, so it's kinda weird to go to church.
miniAvatar:alyosha/novice/sweatsmile.png;
Alexei:How is it that you know my brother better than I do? Do you even believe such rumored words?
changeFigure:lisa/speakingnormal.png;
Lise:I'm just telling you the gossip I heard from my mother ......
I know you used to be so busy with your studies that you weren't very aware of these things yet.
Because that case of your father's was a big deal for a while, and wasn't there never a murderer in that case?
My mother was interested in that case for a while, so she just asked a few more questions of random people, that's all, right?
miniAvatar:alyosha/novice/sweat.png;
Alexei: (Is it surprising that asking a few more random questions makes you know more than even I do?)
:(Someone from the other end of the hallway calls Alexei's name, interrupting the two)
miniAvatar:alyosha/novice/eyemove.png;
changeFigure:lisa/smile.png;
Lise:Ah, listen, I think Mrs. Younger is calling you.
Looks like you've got a busy day ahead of you, in which case I'll be off.
changeFigure:lisa/smileeyeclosed.png;
miniAvatar:alyosha/novice/smile.png;
Next time, I'll invite you over to my place for dinner~

:Lise left.

Somewhat puzzled, Alexei changed out of his robes and entered the community center's consulting room, ready to greet this morning's visitors.
