:Alexei returned to his apartment.
:Vague concern struck Alexei's mind again, his little experience told him that he was wholly inadequate to deal with such symptoms, it was beyond the scope of mere verbal counseling, this acute fainting and coma, and he feared for his ability to control the worst of what was to come.

Alexei:I've always felt that I was limited in the help I could provide...
Alexei:And yet Mentor Zosima told me I could help him.
Alexei:What exactly am I afraid and worried about ......
Alexei:Is it the fear of getting hurt, the consequences of making mistakes in the process or the fear of Ivan?

:With this thought in mind, Alexei was in his apartment organizing the information for today's consultation when the landline in his room suddenly rang, which startled the preoccupied man like a frightened rabbit. Once he had slowed down, he walked quickly to the landline. Ten o'clock, unfamiliar number, this time of day, it couldn't be anyone else, Alexei picked up the phone with a heartbeat:

Alexei: "Hello?"
???? : "Hello ....... Alyosha?"
:It was Ivan's voice, still sounding out of breath, but hearing Ivan's voice had instantly eased Alyosha's worried mind.
Alexei: "Ivan, great, you made it to the apartment right? How are you feeling now?"
Ivan: "I'm fine ......"
Ivan: "I'm at the apartment now ......"
Alexei: "That's good, do you feel anything else strange in your body?"
Ivan: "Uhm! ......."
:There was a sudden heavy whimper and gasp on the other end of the line, followed by a series of murmurs of unknown significance and a brief moment of silence that
Alexei: "Ivan, Ivan?"

???? : "I'm sorry, but your brother may not be able to talk to you for a while."
:An unfamiliar voice came out of the phone, shrill and intoned as if singing an off-key ditty, the strangeness of which made it impossible to separate the gender of the voice.

Alexei: "Hello, is Ivan okay now? And may I ask who you are?"
???? :"......"
???? : "Your brother's friend, I'll be taking care of him, don't worry about him, he's safe here."

Alexei: "You're his friend? May I ask what his condition is?" ;
???? : "I'm not talking to you right now, bye, your brother is busy right now."
:......

:The phone was hung up mercilessly, Alexei bowed his head and placed the receiver slowly on the landline.
:Listening to this, Ivan, he's, maybe sort of okay? Alexei thought so in his mind, and with a hint of doubt, he scratched his head and turned his head to continue on with his work.

????:......
????:...... That's a lot of water coming out, Ivan, how many days has it been since you've been fucked?

:Intermittent moans came out of Ivan's mouth in the darkened room as he was pressed against the crumpled sheets by the man behind him, the sound of their lower bodies colliding gradually drowning out the gasps that were already like sobs.

????:Alexei? ......
????:...... It seems necessary to meet this person ......
