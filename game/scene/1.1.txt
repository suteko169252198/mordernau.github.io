:Ivan's wet tongue trailed downward, gradually touching the organ that lay dormant between the hairs.
:He took the tip of Alexei's and skillfully took the whole thing into his mouth.
:Due to his faith, Alexei had not tried much of those means of self-pleasure...
:The man who was as ignorant as a virgin when it came to sexual matters simply clutched the back of the blood relative in front of him, whom he hadn't seen in years, in panic, feeling himself gradually melt in his warm mouth.
:The clock hanging on the wall was moving so slowly in this situation that Alexei's eyes didn't dare move downward the slightest bit, just looking at the clock hanging on the wall across from his seat, waiting for the hands to tick little by little as he bit into Ivan's shirt, feeling the man before him ramming his organ into himself one at a time, muffling small grunts with the contractions inside him.
:The absurdity of the sight and the hedonistic pleasure of it almost made Alexei almost forget the scene he was in at the moment, who he was, or his relationship with the man in front of him...
: but the next instant, or perhaps it was the clock he glimpsed in his dizziness, the scattered pens and papers, and the closed and locked door that reminded him of his duty.

:In the intervals of brief pleasure gained over and over again, Alexei silently asked in his mind, what is it, that allows me to accept with indifference this affair that corrupts the morals of my profession, the morals of my kinship, and the morals of human decency.
Alexei:Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me sinners......

:And so the first counseling session came to an absurd end in this way, and it was only when Alexei's fluids had completely filled his belly that Ivan rose from this counselor as if in a dream, and the two men, in a shared silence, said nothing and did not look at each other, but simply each straightened out their clothes and cleaned up the bodily fluids that remained on their bodies.
:As the last button of his shirt was buttoned, Alexei's cheeks still reddened, and the thoughts in his head tangled into unraveling knots, the
:Of all the knots produced by these various sorrows, it was undoubtedly the consequences of the affair that most perplexed him, and shook his spirit, and made him fearful:
:How was he to account for it to his tutor, to the school? Or even how to hide the guilt?

Zossima:Judging by the length of the preparatory talks, the content of the report you submitted is still a bit low.
However, considering that this was your first formal counseling session, you are justifiably nervous and inexperienced.
Next time you will need to go deeper into the relationship you have established with the visitor. Do you think you've succeeded in getting the visitor to empathize with you? I don't think so.
Alexei:I'm sorry ...... Zosima, I'm not sure, as you said, in fact, my communication with him today was very limited, the visitor seemed to avoid deeper communication with me when he talked about some topics, maybe I should try to guide him to express those things in words.
Zossima:Well, that does match the characterization I had when I had that session with him...
changeFigure:zossima/handsupsmile.png.
Zossima:Though it is only my personal opinion, and you need only use it as a reference, Alyosha, I think that he, and this may be due to my status, has a respect and a bond with me that is hard to break, a bond that leads me to judge that perhaps I have no more chance of counseling with him, the
changeFigure:zossima/taishoushuohua.png;
Zossima:By the way, so has the visitor done anything unusual or outside of your common sense?
miniAvatar:alyosha/consult/worried.png;
Alexei:......;
Zosima:I can see that you haven't been very happy since the end of the counseling, did something happen?
miniAvatar:alyosha/consult/closedeyeworried.png;
Alyosha:No, he was fairly calm throughout the counseling, though he seemed to be consciously avoiding talking about his family, especially his father's passing.
He didn't seem to care about it though, judging by his expression and attitude, but I guess he hid it well.
miniAvatar:alyosha/consult/worried.png;
Zosima:That's a really important entry point, you should try starting with that next time.
Alexei:Okay, Mentor Zosima ......
miniAvatar:alyosha/consult/seriousmouthopen.png.
Alexei:I was just wondering why it had to be this visitor. As you already know, he is my brother by blood, and I feel like I am looking into a mirror myself when I analyze him.
changeFigure:zossima/handsup/normal.png.
Zossima:......
changeFigure:zossima/handsupserious.png;
Zossima:I did make a lot of considerations, but still, the most important thing is that I want you to be able to see yourself in this counseling as a gesture in the human world and on the way to the future.
Zosima:Though I haven't told you too much about it yet, Alyosha, I've told you before that I may not be able to guide you through the entire academic program during your master's degree.
miniAvatar:alyosha/consult/closedeyeworried.png;
Alexei:Well, it's fine, you told me about it when I first switched departments and I'm ready for it now.
miniAvatar:alyosha/consult/worried.png;
Zosima:I've never worried about you academically, Alyosha.
Zosima:It's just that you might want to prepare yourself for my parting in advance, as my health might not allow me to fulfill all my teaching duties for this academic year.
Zosima:But the academy has already transferred most of my duties to me, so I'm currently the most free instructor in the whole academy, and only need to take care of you and Porphyry, the two students who are under my supervision.
miniAvatar:alyosha/consult/closedeyeworried.png;
Alexei:Mentor Zosima ......
Zossima:I used to have some contact with Ivan early on, but we didn't have a deep personal relationship, either.
changeFigure:zossima/handsupsmile.png;
Zossima:He was studying for his master's degree at that time, at your age, and he asked me some questions, and I personally thought he was a very nice young man, a bit like you nowadays, changeFigure:zossima/handsupsmile.png
Zossima:But then he seemed to be watching you, even though you didn't know much about each other. Perhaps the events of the last few years have brought him to these misfortunes, but, Alyosha, I think you can help him.
Zossima:Do you remember when you were still an undergraduate studying theology but had to apply for a change of department? I told you that the two disciplines share the same reasoning for exploring one's inner abode, except that one seeks the outside and the other seeks the self.
Zossima:So looking back at past experiences, visiting memories of perhaps your shared long ago childhood, but that will help you find your way.
Zossima:Poor man, the older you live, the more sense you attach to what was once the past, ;Ã‚
changeFigure:zossima/handsup/normal.png;
Zossima:Forgive me, Alyosha, but believe me, this is not something that can be measured simply in terms of good or bad, it all depends on your own choices.
Alexei:......
miniAvatar:alyosha/consult/closedeyesmile.png;
Alexei:No, I'm the one who wants to thank you for your teachings along the way, Mentor Zossima, I'll try my best.
changeFigure:zossima/handsupsmile.png;
Zossima:Well okay, I have other things to take care of, so that's it for this report, I can't stay up too long now. I'll schedule the next counseling session, so let me know when you're ready.
miniAvatar:alyosha/consult/normalmouthopen.png;
Alexei:Yes, Mentor Zosima.

Alexei returned to his apartment at the end of the day and lay in bed contemplating the next day's arrangements, but the morning's experience surfaced from the depths of his consciousness and forced him to face the strange affair head on once more.

changeBg:bedroon1.jpg;
Alexei:......
Alexei:So it's surprising that I myself still chose to keep this to myself ...... Is this really out of my own mind.
Alexei:I even chose not to disclose it when Mentor Zosima asked me ......
Alexei:But Ivan ......
Alexei:What would Ivan say ......
Alexei:Given his state at that time, maybe he was having an attack, but I should have been adamant about stopping him, am I even doing him a favor by doing this now...
Alexei:I didn't do that, but I even enjoyed myself shamefully. ...... Can I really lie to myself that this is for his honor and future counseling? ...... What should I do in the future?
Alexei:Continue to hide it? Although there's no monitoring room inside the room and only the two of us know about it ...... but the price on my conscience for carrying this matter is too heavy ...... Next time I should probably still seek out Mentor Zosima to confess it ......
Alexei:......
Alexei:......
Alexei:......

:Turning the prayer rope in his hand, Alexei, wrapped in his bedding, mumbled a prayer, staring out the window at the sparse stars, one, two...
::and the knots of the prayer rope in his hand turned, one by two, in time with the counting of the motions.

Finally, in the midst of this repetitive meditation, sleepiness and weariness swept over him, and he fell into a deep sleep of perplexed thought.
